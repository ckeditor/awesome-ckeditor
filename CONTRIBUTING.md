## Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for considering contributing to this awesome list!

Please pay attention to the following when preparing a pull request:

* All open source projects must be include a link to the Git repository and a short description.
* Not all proposed changes will be accepted given that this is a curated list. Please avoid sending changes that are sales pitches and vendor-specific. Hopefully this could serve as an encouragement to content and project creators to bring more value and innovation to the CKEditor community.
* While feedback will be solicited from other CKEditor maintainers and contributors, it's up to the maintainer of this repo to decide whether a proposed change should be included. Please [contact the maintainer](https://github.com/wojtekidd) if you have any questions.
